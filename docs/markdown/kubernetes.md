```
Kubernetes is an open-source system for
automating deployment,
scaling,
and management of containerized applications.
```
[https://kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io)

Notes:
- From the Kubernetes website
- Their definition
- This sounds very familiar
- 12-Factor Influence


## Kind

```
Kind is a tool for running local
Kubernetes clusters 
using Docker container “nodes”.
```
[Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)

Notes:
- Make Docker the IaaS that we run K8s on
- Kubernetes In Docker


## Demo

Notes:
- I'm not typing this - I'm using DemoMagic - don't tell anyone
- I'm doing these steps because I want you to think about the automation
  - I want you to think about "everything as code"
- create a new cluster & set my context to use the new cluster
- empty cluster, we will come back to that later
